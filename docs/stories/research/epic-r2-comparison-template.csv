SCORING RUBRIC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Visual Quality (25%),"Rating 9-10 = 22-25 pts, 7-8 = 17-21 pts, 5-6 = 12-16 pts, <5 = 0-11 pts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Performance (25%),">60fps = 25 pts, >45fps = 20 pts, >30fps = 15 pts, >15fps = 10 pts, <15fps = 0 pts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Interactivity (15%),"All 3 features = 15 pts, 2 features = 10 pts, 1 feature = 5 pts, 0 features = 0 pts (Camera + Marking + Lighting)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Export Compatibility (15%),"GLTF/JSON export = 15 pts, Partial export = 10 pts, Incompatible = 0 pts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Generation Speed (10%),"<30s = 10 pts, 30-60s = 7 pts, 60-120s = 4 pts, >120s = 0 pts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Infrastructure (10%),"Vercel serverless = 10 pts, Requires server = 5 pts, Complex (GPU servers) = 0 pts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECOMMENDATION TIERS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tier 1 (Recommended),"Total Score ≥70, 60fps on desktop, camera marking working, Vercel compatible",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tier 2 (Viable with Caveats),"Total Score ≥50, meets most requirements, may need infrastructure or quality trade-offs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
