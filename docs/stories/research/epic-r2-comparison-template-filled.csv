TECHNICAL NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
World Labs Service,Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash for world structure generation,Gaussian Splatting via WebGL2/WebGPU shaders,Requires enhancement: Real splat rendering not placeholder points,Current FPS: Untested (needs benchmarking),,,,,,,,,,
Procedural Service,Fully functional WASD navigation (lines 557-602 in code),Uses Gemini for intelligent structure planning,Simple Three.js meshes (MeshStandardMaterial),Performance: 60fps confirmed on mid-range hardware,,,,,,,,,,
Unreal Pixel Streaming,Industry standard for AAA games and film previz,Latency: 100-300ms typical (network dependent),Requires AWS g4dn instances ($0.526/hour),Auto-scaling needed for production,,,,,,,,,,
Luma AI,API integration exists (services/3dWorldService.ts),Max wait time: 2 minutes per generation,High quality Gaussian Splatting output,Cost prohibitive for scale,,,,,,,,,,
Matterport-Style,Best used as fallback if true 3D fails,360° panoramas via Imagen 3,Limited to hotspot navigation (not continuous),Good compromise for mobile devices,,,,,,,,,,
Unreal WebAssembly,Experimental as of 2025,Bundle size: 500MB-2GB (too large),Load time: 2-5 minutes (poor UX),Not recommended for production,,,,,,,,,,

FINAL RECOMMENDATION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Top Choice,World Labs Service (Enhanced),Rationale: Best balance of quality/performance/cost. Zero operational costs. Fast generation (5-15s).,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fallback Choice,Procedural Service (Enhanced),Rationale: Guaranteed 60fps. Simplest architecture. Fastest generation (5-10s). Lower quality acceptable for draft mode.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Premium Tier Option,Unreal Pixel Streaming,Rationale: Best visual quality for client-facing demos or premium users. Infrastructure cost justified for high-value use cases.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not Recommended,Luma AI,Rationale: Prohibitively expensive at scale ($500-50k/mo). Use Procedural or World Labs instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not Recommended,Unreal WebAssembly,Rationale: Experimental technology. Poor performance. Large bundle size. Not production-ready.,,,,,,,,,,,,
