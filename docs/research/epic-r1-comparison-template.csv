SCORING RUBRIC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Visual Consistency (30%),"CLIP >0.90 = 27-30 pts, 0.85-0.90 = 23-26 pts, 0.80-0.85 = 18-22 pts, <0.80 = 0-17 pts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Training Time (15%),"<5min = 15 pts, 5-10min = 10 pts, 10-30min = 5 pts, >30min = 0 pts, N/A = 15 pts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inference Latency (20%),"<15s = 20 pts, 15-30s = 15 pts, 30-60s = 10 pts, 60-120s = 5 pts, >120s = 0 pts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
API Cost (15%),"<$0.05 = 15 pts, $0.05-0.10 = 10 pts, $0.10-0.20 = 5 pts, >$0.20 = 0 pts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Integration Complexity (10%),"<200 LOC = 10 pts, 200-500 LOC = 7 pts, 500-1000 LOC = 4 pts, >1000 LOC = 0 pts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Browser Compatibility (10%),"Vercel serverless = 10 pts, Requires server = 5 pts, Client-only = 0 pts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECOMMENDATION TIERS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tier 1 (Recommended),"Total Score ≥70, meets all critical requirements (consistency >95%, latency OK, browser compatible)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tier 2 (Viable with Caveats),"Total Score ≥50, meets most requirements with trade-offs, may need workarounds",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tier 3 (Not Recommended),"Total Score <50, fails critical requirements, showstoppers identified",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TEST SCENARIOS (for each technology),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scenario 1,Close-up portrait (well-lit),Expected CLIP >0.90,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scenario 2,Wide shot full-body (outdoor),Expected CLIP >0.85,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scenario 3,Profile view (side angle),Expected CLIP >0.85,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scenario 4,Low-light scene (dramatic),Expected CLIP >0.80,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scenario 5,Action pose (dynamic movement),Expected CLIP >0.80,,,,,,,,,,,,,
