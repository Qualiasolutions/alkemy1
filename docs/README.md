## 🎯 V2 Enhancement Vision

**Transform Alkemy into the "Unreal Engine for AI Filmmaking"** - the definitive platform where filmmakers can:
- Work entirely via voice commands when desired
- Trust that characters remain visually identical across all shots
- Compose music and sound design within the same platform
- Receive AI-powered creative guidance throughout production
- Share work and monetize assets within a creator community
